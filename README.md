DBForge Tool
============
_A simple tool built to help make field arrays for use in DBForge, on CodeIgniter projects_


## About the tool

**DBForge Tool** is a JS and PHP-based tool built to help create table arrays to be used with the `dbforge` module on CodeIgniter. In essence, it just helps you build the fields array used when creating a table.

The reason I built this tool is because some code started to become **really** massive on some models to me (specially when I was using more than 4 tables), so I wanted a solution that would lessen the number of lines in the code and, also, let me backup all the table layouts into files (so I could just copy/paste'em, load and rebuild the tables whenever I wanted).

Bear in mind that I'm not a great coder, and this is just a simple tool built to my own needs, so things might require some extra coding for other solutions. The source code is commented as much as possible, but I might have left some things uncommented.

Also, this tool might be something totally not useful, and a fruit of my own inability to come up with a better solution. :sweat:

So use this at your own risk! :sweat_smile::sweat_drops:
