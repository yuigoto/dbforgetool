THE YX PROJECT LICENSE (Yuiti's Cross Project License)
======================================================

	(c) 2017 Fabio Y. Goto

_Version 0.0.1_

> A not-so-open license that was made so I can have closed-source projects, while also maintaining a more controlled openness (because I don't like having a mess with too many forks).

The **YX Project License** states that the contents of this project should **NOT** be made available to the public, but that doesn't mean isn't a fully closed project.

This license, while made to let me properly have a license for closed projects, was also made so I could have a more controlled _open_ environment for my code, which means:

- Not too many (or any) forks of my project, as I don't want, and don't want to make, a mess out of my (and anyone's) code;
- Request to the repository are made on a _per request_ basis to the [owner's e-mail address][mailto01], but once you're in, you're free to go;
- Invited users **cannot** invite other users, but can point to the owner's e-mail so others can request access;
- Access to the code isn't guaranteed to everyone, writing a proper request and _justifying_ your reasons to have access might help;
- Users with access can use anything in their own projects (personal or commercial), **BUT** cannot mention the existence of this repository, neither point to the address of this publicly;
- Crediting is appreciated, _but credit the author's name only_, not the repo link;
